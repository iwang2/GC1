## 1.31.18 - Peering into the depths of color.

### Color Depth
The amount of data used to represent a single pixel.

SIZE | COLOR OPTIONS
--- | ---
1 bit | 1 color; on/off
2 bit | 1 color; on/off, plus 1 bit for intensity
3 bit | Red, Green, Blue; on/off
4 bit | RGB with intensity
6 bit | RGB, each color with its own intensity (each one color has 2 bits)
3 byte | 1 byte for each color; each with 256 possible intensities (~16 million combinations)

### Other Color Spaces
We mostly just use RGB.
- **RGBA:** Red, Green, Blue + Alpha (transparency)
- **HSB:** Hue, Saturation, Brightness (cone diagram)

### Image File Formats
#### Vector
- Vector formats represent images as a series of drawing instructions
- They are infinitely scalable.
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
